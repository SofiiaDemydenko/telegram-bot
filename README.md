telegram bot on java using jsoup library for parsing

This bot allows you to check the newest articles and highlights from Tech Websites and Blogs. Namely from 'Habr' and 'TechCrunch'. 
To understand the Jsoup library additional items were parced and represented in code. Such as rating, bookmarks, views and authors of the articles.

As a first project, it was made before creating GitHub account, therefore it has only main branch.
